# Logistic Regression Binary Classifier - Breast Cancer Dataset

## 🔍 Overview

This project is part of the AI & ML Internship Task 4. The goal is to build a *binary classification model* using *Logistic Regression* on the *Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset*.

---

## 📌 Objective

- Build a logistic regression model to classify tumors as benign or malignant.
- Understand evaluation metrics like precision, recall, ROC-AUC.
- Explore how sigmoid function and threshold tuning impact predictions.

## 📁 Dataset

- *Name*: Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset
- *Source*: [scikit-learn built-in dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer.html)
- *Features*: 30 numeric features
- *Target*: Binary classification (0 = malignant, 1 = benign)

## 📊 Steps Performed

1. Loaded the dataset and explored data.
2. Split into training and testing sets.
3. Standardized the feature values.
4. Trained a logistic regression model.
5. Evaluated the model using:
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Precision
   - Recall
   - ROC-AUC Score
   - ROC Curve
6. Visualized the sigmoid function.
7. Tuned prediction threshold and observed impact.
